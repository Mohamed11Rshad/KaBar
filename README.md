## Libraries and Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building native UIs with less code and powerful tools, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience.
- **Clean Architecture**: This design ensures that the app's core logic is separated from UI and framework concerns, promoting maintainability and scalability.
- **MVVM & MVI**: These architectural patterns allow for a clean separation of concerns, with robust state management and easy-to-maintain code.
- **Paging 3**: For efficiently loading data in chunks, providing a smooth scrolling experience.
- **Retrofit**: For handling API requests and responses, Retrofit simplifies network operations and makes our codebase more readable and maintainable.
- **Room**: As an abstraction layer over SQLite, Room provides a robust database access mechanism while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- **DataStore Preferences**: For a lightweight, consistent approach to storing key-value pairs, improving upon SharedPreferences with coroutines and Flow.
- **Dagger Hilt**: For dependency injection, Dagger Hilt reduces boilerplate and simplifies app architecture by providing dependencies in a scalable way.
- **Coroutines**: Coroutines facilitate asynchronous programming, enabling tasks to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread, leading to a more responsive user interface.

## Project Progress

KaBar is an active project with continuous improvements. We're dedicated to providing users with an efficient, informative, and engaging news consumption experience.
